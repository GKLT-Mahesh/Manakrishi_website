# Image Generation Status Report

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Tasks:**
1.  **Field Operations Images:** (Chilli, Cotton, Sugarcane, Maize, Orchard, Paddy) - FAILED (Capacity)
2.  **The Cycle of Intelligence Images:** (Digital Booking, Rapid Deployment, Precision Action, Bountiful Harvest) - FAILED (Capacity)

## Status: FAILED (Temporarily)

I attempted to generate high-quality, realistic images for "The Cycle of Intelligence" section, but the AI image generation service continued to return the following error:

> `503 Service Unavailable: No capacity available for model gemini-3-pro-image on the server`

## Recommendations

1.  **Use Existing Images:** I have updated the section title to "The Cycle of Intelligence" and enhanced the CSS for the existing images (`drone-3d.png`, `tech-scan.png`, `drone-spraying-action.jpg`, `story-1.png`) to maximize their visual impact.
2.  **Manual Upload:** If you have specific images, please upload them to `assets/` and update the `src` attributes in `index.html`.
3.  **Retry Later:** You can ask me to try generating again when the service stabilizes.

## Actions Taken
- Updated section title in `index.html` to matches "The Cycle of Intelligence".
- Enhanced CSS for `.step-card` images with saturation and contrast filters.
- Documented the failure in this report.
